# IP Info Lookup

**IP Info Lookup** is a lightweight, browser-based web application that allows users to retrieve detailed information about any IPv4 address using a public IP geolocation API.

This project is entirely frontend-based, with no server-side components (besides the public APIs) required.

You may change the API key with your own private one as long as its from the same API server, or there may be issues in terms of formatting etc...
